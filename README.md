Convert audio file format using python


If you didn't know this already, I have a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/4z357EuGAo7z7cXTRlxzsn?si=u6tt3UQyQDSeDx_FE71KVA&nd=1), and as a result I work with audio files and occasionally I have to convert an audio file from one format to another. I become curious and wanted to find a quicker (and cheaper) way to do the conversion, hence the script.

You can replace the 'audpath' variable with the correct location of your audio. You can even take it a step further by converting multiple files in a directory.
